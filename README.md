# smartCar
The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs.

Some innovative features that could be integrated into smart cars:
1. Gesture Control: Implementing gesture recognition technology can allow drivers to interact with the car's infotainment system and control various functions with simple hand movements, reducing distractions.
2. Biometric Authentication: Use facial recognition or fingerprint scanning for secure vehicle access and personalized settings.
3. Augmented Reality Windshield: Incorporate an augmented reality (AR) heads-up display on the windshield to provide real-time navigation, traffic data, and information about nearby points of interest.
4. 360-Degree Cameras: Install cameras around the car to create a bird's-eye-view display, aiding in parking and providing better situational awareness.
5. Emotion Detection: Utilize cameras and sensors to analyze the driver's emotions and adjust settings accordingly, like playing soothing music during moments of stress.
6. Health Monitoring: Integrate health monitoring sensors to track the driver's vital signs, alerting them and emergency services in case of a medical emergency.
7. Holographic Controls: Replace physical buttons and knobs with holographic touch controls that can adapt to different functions, reducing clutter and providing a futuristic look.
8. Solar Roof: Equip the car with solar panels on the roof to help recharge the battery and increase energy efficiency.
9. Scent Dispenser: Allow drivers to customize the interior scent of the car with a built-in dispenser, creating a more pleasant driving environment.
10. Voice Assistant Integration: Improve voice recognition and integration with a natural language processing AI to make communication with the car more intuitive.
11. In-Car Entertainment Ecosystem: Create a versatile entertainment system that can stream content, support virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) experiences, and connect with other smart devices.
12. Adaptive Suspension: Implement an advanced suspension system that can automatically adjust to road conditions and provide a smoother ride.
13. Dynamic Paint or LED Panels: Use color-changing or LED panels on the exterior to change the car's appearance, indicate different driving modes, or even display messages.
14. Personalized Aromatherapy: Offer a selection of aromatherapy scents that passengers can choose to enhance their comfort and well-being.
15. Driver Education and Assistance: Provide on-demand driving lessons and tips through the car's infotainment system to improve driving skills and safety.
16. Mood Lighting: Install customizable interior lighting that can change color and intensity to match the driver's mood or create a relaxing atmosphere.
17. Remote Parking and Summoning: Enable the car to park itself in tight spaces or come to the driver's location when summoned via a smartphone app.
18. Interactive Windows: Use augmented reality or touch-sensitive windows to display information, games, or educational content for passengers.
19. Emergency Escape Systems: Incorporate tools like a built-in fire extinguisher, emergency oxygen supply, or a window-breaking mechanism for enhanced safety during emergencies.
20. Smart Mirrors: Replace traditional rearview and side mirrors with high-resolution cameras and screens for improved visibility and reduced blind spots.
